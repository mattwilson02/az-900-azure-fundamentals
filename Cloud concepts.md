**Cloud Computing**: the delivery of computing services over the internet.
- Virtual machines
- Storage
- Databases
- Networking
- Internet of Thing (IoT)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

*Cloud computing isn't constrained by physical infrastructure*

"Pay for only the services you use"
### Compute power
*how much processing you computer can do*
### Storage
*volume of data you can store on your computer*

Cloud computing includes the ability to **scale elastically**, adding and removing compute power and storage as it is needed.
	- **Cost**
	- **Speed**
	- **Global scale** 
	- **Productivity**
	- **Performance**
	- **Reliability**
	- **Security**

### Shared responsibility model

Cloud provider: physical security, power, cooling and network connectivity
Consumer: data and information, access security

### Cloud models

**Private cloud**: used by a single entity, providing greater control for the country and IT department, as it may hosted from your own datacenter.

**Public Cloud**: built, controlled and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. (public availability)

**Hybrid Cloud**: uses both in an interconnected environment. Private clouds can then surge temporarily, by deploying public cloud resources.
