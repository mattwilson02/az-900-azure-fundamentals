**Cloud Computing**: the delivery of computing services, such as **compute power** and **storage**, over the internet.
- Virtual machines
- Storage
- Databases
- Networking
- Internet of Thing (IoT)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

*Cloud computing isn't constrained by physical infrastructure*

"Pay for only the services you use"
### Compute power
*how much processing you computer can do*
### Storage
*volume of data you can store on your computer*

Cloud computing includes the ability to **scale elastically**, adding and removing compute power and storage as it is needed.
	- **Cost**
	- **Speed**
	- **Global scale** 
	- **Productivity**
	- **Performance**
	- **Reliability**
	- **Security**

### Shared responsibility model

The distribution of responsibilities between the provider and consumer of the cloud services

**Cloud provider**: physical security, power, cooling and network connectivity
**Consumer**: data and information, access security (only give access to those who need it)

**How responsibility is distributed**

***Information and data, devices, accounts and identities*** 
- Responsibility always retained by **customer**

***Identity and directory infra*** 
- **IaaS**, responsibility is **customer**
- **PaaS** and SaaS, responsiblity is **shared**

***Applications***
- **IaaS**, responsibility is **customer**
- **PaaS**, responsibility is **shared**
- **SaaS**, responsiblity is **provider (Microsoft)**

***Network controls***
- **IaaS**, responsibility is **customer**
- **PaaS**, responsibility is **shared**
- **SaaS**, responsiblity is **provider (Microsoft)**

***Operation System***
- **IAAS**, responsibility is **customer**
- **PaaS**, responsiblity is **provider (Microsoft)**
- **SaaS**, responsiblity is **provider (Microsoft)**

***Physical hosts, networks and datacenter***
- Responsiblity retained by **provider**

**When using a cloud provider, youâ€™ll always be responsible for:**

- The information and data stored in the cloud
- Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
- The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

**The cloud provider is always responsible for:**

- The physical datacenter
- The physical network
- The physical hosts

**Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:**

- Operating systems
- Network controls
- Applications
- Identity and infrastructure

### Cloud models

**Private cloud**: used by a single entity, providing greater control for the country and IT department, as it may hosted from your own datacenter.

**Public Cloud**: built, controlled and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. (public availability)

**Hybrid Cloud**: uses both in an interconnected environment. Private clouds can then surge temporarily, by deploying public cloud resources.
