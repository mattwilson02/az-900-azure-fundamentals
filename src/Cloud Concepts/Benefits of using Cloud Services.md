### Availability (%)
*the proportion of time a service is operational and accessible when needed*
### Scalability
*the ability to adjust resources to meet demand*

**Vertical Scaling**: increasing or decreasing capabilities of resources

*Examples:*
	Scale to add more CPUs or RAM to the VM, or vertically scale down by lowering specifications.

**Horizontal Scaling**: adding or removing number of resources

*Examples:*
	Deployed resources could be scaled in or out to meet demand

### Reliability
*the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function*

- Cloud has a decentralised design, allowing you to deploy resources in regions globally
- In some cases, your cloud environment will shift to a different region, with no action needed

### Predictability

**Cost Predictability**: *forecasting cost of expenses*
- Track resource use in real time
- Monitor resources to ensure efficiency
- Apply data analytics

**Performance Predictability**: *focuses on predicting resources needed to deliver a positive experience for customers*
- Autoscaling
- Loading balancing
- High availability

### Benefits of Cloud Management

- Automatically scale resource deployment
- Deploy template resources (no need for manual config)
- Monitor health of resources and replace failing ones
- Receive auto alerts, allowing real-time observability
