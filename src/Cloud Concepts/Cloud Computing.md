**Cloud Computing**: the delivery of computing services, such as **compute power** and **storage**, over the internet.

*Pay as you go pricing model

- Virtual machines
- Storage
- Databases
- Networking
- Internet of Thing (IoT)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

*Cloud computing isn't constrained by physical infrastructure*

"Pay for only the services you use"
### Compute power
*how much processing you computer can do*
### Storage
*volume of data you can store on your computer*

Cloud computing includes the ability to **scale elastically**, adding and removing compute power and storage as it is needed.

	- **Speed**
	- **Global scale** 
	- **Productivity**
	- **Performance**
	- **Reliability**
	- **Security**

### Shared responsibility model

The distribution of responsibilities between the provider and consumer of the cloud services

**Cloud provider**: physical security, power, cooling and network connectivity
**Consumer**: data and information, access security (only give access to those who need it)

**How responsibility is distributed**

***Information and data, devices, accounts and identities*** 
- Responsibility always retained by **customer**

***Identity and directory infrastructure***
- **IaaS**, responsibility is **customer**
- **PaaS** and SaaS, responsibility is **shared**

***Applications***
- **IaaS**, responsibility is **customer**
- **PaaS**, responsibility is **shared**
- **SaaS**, responsibility is **provider (Microsoft)**

***Network controls***
- **IaaS**, responsibility is **customer**
- **PaaS**, responsibility is **shared**
- **SaaS**, responsibility is **provider (Microsoft)**

***Operation System***
- **IAAS**, responsibility is **customer**
- **PaaS**, responsiblity is **provider (Microsoft)**
- **SaaS**, responsiblity is **provider (Microsoft)**

***Physical hosts, networks and datacenter***
- Responsiblity retained by **provider**

**When using a cloud provider, youâ€™ll always be responsible for:**

- The information and data stored in the cloud
- Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
- The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

**The cloud provider is always responsible for:**

- The physical datacenter
- The physical network
- The physical hosts

**Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:**

- Operating systems
- Network controls
- Applications
- Identity and infrastructure

### Cloud models

**Private cloud**: used by a single entity, providing greater control for the country and IT department, as it may hosted from your own datacenter.

- Organisations have complete control over resources and security
- Data is not collocated with other organisations data
- Hardware must be purchased
- Organisation is responsible for hardware maintenance and updates

**Public Cloud**: **built, controlled and maintained** by a *third-party* cloud provider. (public availability) 

- No capital expenditures to scale up
- Applications can be quickly provisioned and de-provisioned
- Organisations pay only for what they use
- Organisations don't have complete control over resources and security

*key difference between private and public is **general public availability***

**Hybrid Cloud**: uses both in an interconnected environment. Private clouds can surge temporarily, by deploying public cloud resources.

- Flexible
- Organisations determine where to run applications
- Organisations control security, compliance or legal requirements

**Multi Cloud**: use multiple public cloud providers, potentially using different features from each.

What is **Azure Arc**?

A set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment.

**Azure VMware Solution**: lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

### Consumption-based model

**CapEx (Capital Expenditure)**: one-time, up-front to secure tangible resources (building a datacenter)

**OpEx (Operational Expenditure)**: spending money on products or services over time (signing up for cloud services)

Cloud computing = Operational Expenditure
*'You pay for the resources you use'*

**Benefits of consumption-based model**

- No upfront cost
- No need to purchase and manage infra
- Ability to pay for more resources when needed and stop paying for resources when they aren't needed

**Reasons for using cloud services**

- Plan and manage operating costs
- Run infra more efficiently
- Scale as business needs change
